#Canada_Windmill_DCoutput
#This repository was made to investigate the use of a windmills to generate electricity in different provinces in Canada. 
The collected data on the DC output from these windmills and the corresponding wind velocity. The data is uploaded and listed as "Windmill_.csv".
Build a model to predict the DC output for a given wind speed in mph (mile per hour).
